 # The Blogger-Original Website Edition 

**The Blogger-Original Website Edition** is an app which is based on the official app of **Blogger** by **Google LLC**
**The Blogger-Original** **Website Edition** is a rebuild project of **Blogger** app.
**Blogger** the app is available in the market right now. 
It Has About 10 Million+ Downloads.
But it has some issues. 
What are they?

Actually, **Blogger** has their official website as ***https://www.blogger.com*** And there is a lot of features inside the **Blogger's** official website, like adding links, theming the blog, changing fonts etc. 
But the app doesn't have so much features. 
So people can't do that kind of stuffs in the app that they can do in the website of **Blogger**. 
So I thought about that and tried to make an app of **Blogger** like the official website edition of **Blogger**. 
There is no other alternatives of **Blogger** in the market right now and people are still using the app **Blogger** without that kind of features which is harmful for them because people will be irritated or they get frustrated if they can't find comfortable things in a blog site. So that's why I thought that I should make an app to help people.

The project for **The Blogger-Original** **Website Edition** was started at March 2018 but kind of problems happened during making the app. 
This app is being made using the main website of **Blogger**. No other websites weren't used while making the app.

* **Blogging** is a skill of a person.
People can spread peace, love by **Blogging**.
So if a man can't blog perfectly so he could get frustrated and exhausted. 
It's the perfect way to give human that kind of guide that a human wants depending on how the content is.
**Blogger** is the world's best free website for users and developers to do things in a website. 
It has the best and correct domain which is appreciated by users. 
There are a lot of free sub domains available in the market right note but **Blogger** has the perfect domain for users (example***.blogspot.com***). 
Google LLC also gives free **SSL Certificate** **(https)** in a blogspot site if you use the domain (example.**blogspot.com****).

Although there is tons of features inside the blogger app but to use the features as an app will be more easy and fun to do. 
That's why I made the project for an app Although there is tons of features inside the blogger app but to use the features as an app will be more easy and fun to do. 
That's why I made the project for an app **The Blogger-Original Website Edition.
